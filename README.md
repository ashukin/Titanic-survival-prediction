# Titanic-survival-prediction
The goal was to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. For each entry in the test set, we had to predict a 0 or 1 value for the variable.
The model was trained using ANN(Artificial Neural Networks). It is a deep learning technique. We used the Keras deep learning framework, which is a high level API on top of 
Tensorflow. Keras is becoming super popular recently because of its simplicity. Itâ€™s very easy to  build complex models and iterate rapidly.
